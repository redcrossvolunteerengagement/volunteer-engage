# Setup

To set up, you have to create a virtualenv.

    virtualenv ~/redcross_venv
    source ~/redcross_venv/bin/activate

Then you must install our base libraries that you need to run the server in that virtualenv

    pip install -r requirements.pip


This should download build and install a bunch of things for you so you don't have to go hunt for libraries for your distro or on the internet.
