## **Connect** with Dispatcher
Connect with Disaster Action Team (DAT) dispatchers to ensure an effective Red Cross response. Dispatchers coordinate disaster responses to all sorts of crises and it is vital that they receive accurate information quickly. This app makes it easy for you to share information that you see as relevant to any crisis situation. The dispatcher considers the input from volunteers using the app and then makes an informed decision. 

## **Contact Volunteers**
Contact volunteers in your immediate area or connect with people who are responding to crises all over the country.  Every single day, the Red Cross relies on the selfless efforts of millions of volunteers to accomplish its humanitarian mission. Share your volunteering stories with fellow volunteers. See what ordinary people from diverse backgrounds can accomplish with extraordinary determination. 

## **Locate** Volunteers
Locate volunteers in your neighborhood, town, or city based on GPS. Foster discussion about disaster event responses that you and your fellow volunteers have participated in or read about on the news feed. Grow the Red Cross community by reaching out and meeting up with volunteers close to you. Become more informed and involved so that you can use your experience locally.
