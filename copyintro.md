## **Connect** with Dispatcher

Dispatchers coordinate disaster responses to all manner of crises and it is crucial that they receive accurate information quickly. This app makes it easy for you to share information that you see as relevant to any crisis situation. The dispatcher consider the input from volunteers using the app and then makes an informed decision.
