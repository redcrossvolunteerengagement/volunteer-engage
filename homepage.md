## **Welcome!**

Start using this Volunteer Engagement application to connect with and contact fellow volunteers and dispatchers! Simply login to your volunteer account, or create a new one if you do not have an account. You can start using the Field Report feature to submit your descriptions of ongoing crisis responses or to inform dispatchers and volunteers if you are the first one to encounter a crisis. You can also view the up-to-date incident log and become informed on how volunteers all over the country or close to your home are contributing to the Red Cross effort. Make this application part of your everyday life and grow the Red Cross community!  

If you want to learn about volunteering for the Red Cross, go to http://www.redcross.org/ for more information.
